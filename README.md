# C Projects 🧠

A collection of **10 small C projects** to revise and strengthen core C programming concepts.

Pure C.  
No frameworks.  
Just fundamentals.

---

## 📌 Goals
- Revise C basics
- Improve logic & problem-solving
- Write clean, readable C code

## 📂 Projects

1. **Number Guessing Game**
   - Random number generation
   - Loops & conditionals
   - Input validation
   - Attempt counter
   - Play-again feature

2. **Simple Calculator**
   - Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
   - Loops to allow multiple calculations
   - Input validation to avoid divide-by-zero errors
   - Clear, user-friendly prompts
   - Play multiple times without restarting

3. **Tic-Tac-Toe (2 Players)**
   - Classic 2-player game on a 3x3 grid
   - Players alternate turns placing X and O
   - Input validation prevents overwriting cells
   - Detects wins in rows, columns, and diagonals
   - Detects draw when the board is full

4. **Bank Management System**
   - Manage multiple customer accounts
   - Menu-driven system with options to create account, deposit, withdraw, and view account details
   - Persistent storage using file I/O (`accounts.dat`)
   - Input validation to prevent invalid transactions
   - Handles multiple accounts and maintains balances across sessions
   
5. **To-Do List Application**
   - Menu-driven console application to manage daily tasks
   - Add, view, and delete tasks dynamically
   - Stores tasks using arrays and string handling
   - Persistent storage using file I/O (`tasks.txt`)
   - Tasks are automatically loaded when the program starts

6. **Student Record Management System**
   - Menu-driven console application to manage student records
   - Uses structures to store student details (roll, name, marks)
   - Implements pointers for efficient data manipulation
   - Persistent storage using binary file handling (`students.dat`)
   - Supports searching student records by roll number

7. **Stack Implementation Using Linked List**
   - Menu-driven stack implementation using linked list
   - Demonstrates dynamic memory allocation using `malloc` and `free`
   - Core stack operations: push, pop, peek, and display
   - Uses pointers and self-referential structures
   - Handles stack overflow and underflow safely

8. **Binary Search Tree (BST) Implementation in C**
   - Menu-driven BST implementation using pointers and recursion
   - Supports dynamic insertion, search, deletion, and tree traversal
   - Traversals include Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder
   - Proper memory management using `malloc` and `free`
   - Demonstrates advanced pointer handling and recursive logic
