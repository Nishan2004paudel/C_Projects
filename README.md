# 🧠 C Projects

A curated collection of **10 small C projects** designed to **revise fundamentals**, **strengthen logic**, and **improve problem-solving skills** using pure C programming.

No frameworks.  
No external libraries.  
Just **core C concepts**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Reinforce C programming fundamentals  
- Improve logical thinking and algorithmic skills  
- Practice writing clean, readable, and maintainable C code  
- Gain hands-on experience with file handling, pointers, and data structures

## 📁 Project List

### 1. Number Guessing Game
- Random number generation  
- Loops and conditional statements  
- Input validation  
- Attempt counter  
- Play-again functionality  

---

### 2. Simple Calculator
- Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Loop-based execution for multiple calculations  
- Input validation to prevent divide-by-zero errors  
- Clear and user-friendly prompts  
- Run multiple operations without restarting  

---

### 3. Tic-Tac-Toe (2 Players)
- Classic 2-player game on a 3×3 grid  
- Alternating turns with `X` and `O`  
- Prevents overwriting occupied cells  
- Detects wins (rows, columns, diagonals)  
- Detects draw when the board is full  

---

### 4. Bank Management System
- Manages multiple customer accounts  
- Menu-driven interface  
- Create account, deposit, withdraw, and view details  
- Persistent storage using file I/O (`accounts.dat`)  
- Input validation for secure transactions  

---

### 5. To-Do List Application
- Console-based task management system  
- Add, view, and delete tasks  
- Uses arrays and string handling  
- Persistent storage using file I/O (`tasks.txt`)  
- Automatically loads tasks at program start  

---

### 6. Student Record Management System
- Menu-driven student record system  
- Uses structures to store roll number, name, and marks  
- Pointer-based data manipulation  
- Binary file handling (`students.dat`)  
- Search records by roll number  

---

### 7. Stack Implementation Using Linked List
- Menu-driven stack operations  
- Implemented using linked lists  
- Dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)  
- Core operations: push, pop, peek, display  
- Handles stack overflow and underflow safely  

---

### 8. Binary Search Tree (BST) in C
- Menu-driven BST implementation  
- Dynamic insertion, search, and deletion  
- Tree traversals:
  - Inorder  
  - Preorder  
  - Postorder  
- Recursive logic and pointer manipulation  
- Proper memory management  

---

### 9. Sorting Algorithms in C
- Menu-driven implementation of sorting techniques  
- Pointer-based swapping and array manipulation  
- Includes:
  - Bubble Sort  
  - Selection Sort  
  - Insertion Sort  
  - Quick Sort (recursive, divide-and-conquer)  
- Demonstrates recursion, pointers, and algorithmic thinking  

---

### 10. Coming Soon 🚧
- Another C project to expand logic and data-structure knowledge
